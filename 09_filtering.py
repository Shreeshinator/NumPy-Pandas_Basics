# Filtering in numpy is the process of selecting elements from an array based on certain conditions.

teenagers = ages[ages < 18] # Filter ages less than 18 (boolean indexing)
print("Teenagers:", teenagers) # Print the filtered array of teenagers

#>>>>>>>>> ARRAY IS NOW FLATENED TO 1D ARRAY OF TEENAGERS <<<<<<<<<<<<<
adults = ages[ages >= 18] # Filter ages greater than or equal to 18 (boolean indexing)
print("Adults:", adults) # Print the filtered array of adults
#>>>>>>>>> ARRAY IS NOW FLATENED TO 1D ARRAY OF ADULTS <<<<<<<<<<<<<

senior_citizens = ages[ages >= 65] # Filter ages greater than or equal to 65 (boolean indexing)
print("Senior Citizens:", senior_citizens) # Print the filtered array of senior citizens
seniors = np.where((ages >= 65) & (ages < 100)) # Filter senior citizens less than 100 (boolean indexing)   keeps shape but SLOOWWW
